# BPMN PoC Form.io test forms

The forms in this directory were exported from https://form.io/ and are used for the BPMN PoC which was added to the ZAC code base in September 2024.
See: https://dimpact.atlassian.net/browse/PZ-3725 for details.

This data should be deleted the moment it is decided to either embrace this (BPMN Form.io) functionality or to remove it as a whole. 
If we are going to support Form.io forms we need to implement functionality to upload these forms dynamically instead
of adding them to the code base.
