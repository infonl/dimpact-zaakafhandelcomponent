# App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

## Type safety

Please read about our [end-to-end type safety](../../../docs/development/endToEndTypeSafety.md) in this Angular app with openapi-typescript, aligning frontend and backend. The ZacHttpClient ensures type-safe requests and responses for better debugging.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

From the folder you want the scaffolding done, run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. Run `npm run start` to run the built version.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests

From the root of the project execute script `./start-e2e-with-test-env.sh` or `./start-e2e-with-local-env.sh` to execute the end-to-end tests using Playwright. At the moment the local tests need more zaakType data to run succesfully.
