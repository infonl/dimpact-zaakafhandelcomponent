# Installation guide

To install ZAC you can use our [Helm chart](../../../charts/zac/Chart.yaml) and fill-in all values that do not have a
default value (they have an empty object, array or string).

It will be best to check the ZAC Helm Chart [README.md](../../../charts/zac/README.md) for installation instructions and information about the 
values that can/have to be provided on installation.
