<_Guideline for filling in: Describes the interfaces required for the external touchpoints for system integration and the principles behind the integration architecture at a high level. Consider including details about the (a)synchronous nature of some integrations and integration-specific assumptions that determine the main areas of effort. For complex integrations, which span multiple systems, this view provides the end-to-end overview and the key design decisions that arise from it._>
