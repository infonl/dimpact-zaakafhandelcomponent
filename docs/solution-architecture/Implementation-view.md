<_Guideline for filling in: This is the core of the solution and represents architectural and technological choices. The solution architect should place the architectural diagram here, for instance, whether it's a 3-tier, N-tier, or event-driven architecture, along with the reasoning behind it. You should also describe the technological choices, for example, the use of Java versus Node.js, along with the pros and cons of using them. You aim to justify the resources and skills needed to carry out the project in the implementation view. The development team uses an implementation view to create a detailed design, like a class diagram, but that doesn't have to be part of the solution architecture._>
