<_Guideline for filling in: Describes architecturally significant solutions to achieve the agreed non-functional requirements (NFRs). Each change is mapped to the corresponding NFR category, which is based on the ISO/IEC 25010-2011 product quality model. Examples of things to document include caching architecture, load balancing, and how the solution ensures the chosen redundancy approach._>

* Performance (e.g. latency and throughput)
* Scalability (e.g. data and traffic volumes)
* Availability (e.g. uptime, downtime, scheduled maintenance, 24Ã—7, 99.9%, etc)
* Security (e.g. authentication, authorisation, data confidentiality)
* Extensibility
* Flexibility
* Auditability
* Monitoring and management
* Reliability
* Failover/disaster recovery targets (e.g. manual vs automatic, how long will this take?)
* Interoperability
* Legal and regulatory requirements (e.g. data protection act)
* Internationalisation and localisation
* Accessibility
