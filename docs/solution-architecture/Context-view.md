The context of the renewed e-Suite describes the environment of the renewed e-Suite and considers the renewed e-Suite as a black box. Components of the environment of that black box are:

- **Customers and end users**: Residents, chain partners, and companies (including self-employed individuals) and employees use the renewed e-Suite. Functional administrators set up the renewed e-Suite.

- **Authentication**: Connection to authentication provisions such as DigiD and eHerkenning.

- **External systems**: This refers to the links with TSA's, scanning facilities, document creation, and other handling components.

- **Basic data**: The link with APIs for basic data. The "HaalCentraal" services are used for personal data, possibly later also for company data. PDOK services represent a collection of APIs including BAG and BGT.

- **Work and Income**: The connection to Suwinet is mentioned (as an example).

- **DSO**: This stands for "Digitaal Stelsel Omgevingswet" in dutch; the renewed e-Suite is connected to the trigger messages of the "Omgevingsloket" to be able to receive permit applications.
