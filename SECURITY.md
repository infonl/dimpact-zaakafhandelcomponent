# Security Policy

The ZAC development team takes security of our application seriously.
We very much appreciate your help in identifying and addressing any security vulnerabilities.
While we have automated processes in place to help preventing security vulnerabilities in the application as much as possible,
we realize that this will never give a 100% guarantee.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our code base, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

Instead, please email [the maintainers](mailto:dimpact-team-geneve-d-aaaakaayu7miexe5zhcylrwe7a@infonl.slack.com).

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
