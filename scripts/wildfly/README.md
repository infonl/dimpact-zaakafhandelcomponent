# Local WildFly development

If you wish run ZAC locally for development purposes, e.g. from within the IntelliJ IDEA IDE,
you can use this script to install a local WildFly instance.
These steps are part of the overall [ZAC installation instructions](../../docs/development/INSTALL.md).

Note that this local WildFly installation is _not_ used in the ZAC build process at all.

To install WildFly:

1. Run the `install-wildfly.sh` script.
2. This should install a local and configured version of Wildfly in the root of this project.
