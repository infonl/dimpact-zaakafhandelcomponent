This repository contains the source code of the "zaakafhandelcomponent" (ZAC), developed for [Dimpact](https://www.dimpact.nl/).
The zaakafhandelcomponent is an open-source, generic, workflow-based component for managing 'zaken'
in the context of [zaakgericht werken](https://www.noraonline.nl/wiki/Zaakgericht_Werken), a Dutch approach to case management.
It is used by various Dutch municipalities.

ZAC was initially [developed by Atos](https://github.com/NL-AMS-LOCGOV/zaakafhandelcomponent).
Starting July 2023 the development of ZAC was taken over by Lifely and INFO.nl, where INFO.nl is a partner of Lifely.
