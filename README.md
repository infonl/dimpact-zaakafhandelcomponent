in the context of [zaakgericht werken](https://www.noraonline.nl/wiki/Zaakgericht_Werken), a Dutch approach to case management.
It is developed for Dimpact and used by Dutch municipalities.

ZAC was initially [developed by Atos](https://github.com/NL-AMS-LOCGOV/zaakafhandelcomponent).
Starting July 2023 the development of ZAC was taken over by Lifely and INFO, where INFO is a partner of Lifely.
