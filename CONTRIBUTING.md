# Contribution guidelines

If you want to contribute, we ask you to follow these guidelines.
These instructions are currently mainly intended for our own Lifely developers, but
we do also welcome contributions from the open source community.
Please reach out to us if you have questions or wish to contribute.

## License

We use [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) license identifiers in source code files.

When adding a new source code file or modifying an existing one as a Lifely/INFO developer, please update the `SPDX` license identifier accordingly:

### Adding a new source code file

For most source code files (e.g. `.ts`, `.js` and `.java` files) please add the following SPDX license identifier to the top of the file:

```
/*
 * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2023 Lifely
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2+
 */
```

For other file types (e.g. `.html` and `.xml` files) please add the following SPDX license identifier to the top of the file:

```
 <!--
  ~ SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2023 Lifely
  ~ SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2+
  -->
```

Finally for e.g. `.sh` files please add:

```
#
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2023 Lifely
# SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2+
#
```

Tip: configure your IDE to automatically add these headers to new source code files.
For example, in IntelliJ IDEA please follow the instructions on https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/copyright.html.

### Modifying an existing source code file

Please update the SPDX license identifier to the top of the file by adding a `, <YEAR> Lifely` to
the `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` identifier. E.g.:

```
/*
 * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2021 Atos, 2023 Lifely
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2+
 */
```

## Conventional Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for our commit messages.
Specifically we use the following format for our commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[body]

[footer]
```

When you create a Pull Request (PR) please follow the following instructions to comply to our Conventional Commits guidelines:
1. Make sure the PR title complies to: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`. E.g. `feat: add new feature`.
2. In the PR body fill in the body consisting of one line of text. E.g. `Added new exciting feature.`
3. In the footer reference the JIRA issue (typically a subtask) number from the
    [PodiumD Zaak JIRA project](https://dimpact.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PZ/) as follows:
    `Solves PZ-XXX`, where `XXX` is the JIRA issue number.

For example:

We use the [Conventional Commits GitHub Action](https://github.com/agenthunt/conventional-commit-checker-action) to check
if a new PR complies to our Conventional Commits guidelines described above.

This plugin unfortunately only checks on PR creation time and not when you merge your PR.
So when merging a PR in GitHub using Squash and Merge please copy the PR body into the
GitHub Squash and Merge description text area.
